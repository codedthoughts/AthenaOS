# AthenaOS
An extendable desktop assistant for Linux.
AOSR (AthenaOS Reborn) is a small home project of mine that's designed to be an all-in-one center of useful tools that I could ever need. If i need quick translations, word defnitions, calculations, dice rolls, etc, I think it fits in this project.
I'm no expert programmer by any means, but I really want to try and bring a form of Siri or Cortana or something similar to Linux, that is light-weight, open-source, and easily extendable.
Mainly i design the features around what I would like in a desktop assistant, but leaving it open enough for if someone has their own ideas, they can easily plug in their own code without potentionally breaking anything else.


More help coming soon.
